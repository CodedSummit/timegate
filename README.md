# timegate
 
This project is a timing gate for use with FRC robots. The arduino code is designed for an ESP32 dev board. The Fusion 360 file contains the designs for a box cut from ply wood (with a CNC), and a 3d printed instrument panel for the top and magnetic cover for the bottom to allow access to change the batteries.
